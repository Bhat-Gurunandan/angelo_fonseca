            Misunderstood and misrepresented then, and purposefully
            ignored throughout the intervening decades, the main body
            of his paintings somehow survived intact via the
            extraordinary faith, courage and determination of his
            widow, the indomitable Ivy da Fonseca. Emerging now in the
            light of the 21st century, it is amply clear these
            paintings are of immense global significance. What is
            more, their publication in this meticulously compiled and
            lovingly produced volume feels nothing short of
            miraculous. Out of nowhere, in an astonishing twist of
            fate, it seems that justice will finally be served to
            Indian art history, more than 50 years after the artist
            himself departed our world.

            How did this staggering lacuna occur in the first place?
            Why did Fonseca’s irresistibly gorgeous paintings
            disappear so thoroughly from our collective understanding
            that even the nearly-1000-page Encyclopaedia of Visual Art
            of Maharashtra – which lists hundreds of artists – fails
            to record even an inkling their presence?  The short
            answer is that there have been several layers of bigotry
            at work, starting with the fatally flawed global backdrop,
            as Dr. Rupert Arrowsmith has most usefully described in
            his invaluable Modernism and the Museum: Asian, African,
            and Pacific Art and the London Avant-Garde (Oxford
            University Press, 2011).
          </p>
          <p>
            Arrowsmith lays out the problem on the very first page of
            his introduction: “There is a problem with the study of
            Modernism as a global phenomenon. Histories of the period
            have been written, until very recently, by scholars with
            little or no knowledge of the culture provinces other than
            their own, resulting in a situation where the dots of
            apparently discrete geographical regions are not
            adequately connected by lines of influence.”
          </p>
          <p>
            These blind spots have “led to a distorted view of
            Modernism as essentially a European invention, with
            comparable movements on other parts of the globe
            characterized as imitative of ‘advanced’ art and
            literature in Europe, or – paradoxically – as reactionary
            and propagandistic. The possibility of multi-directional,
            transnational exchange in aesthetic concepts,
            art-historical knowledge, and literary and artistic
            technique is thus discounted, played down, or at best
            acknowledged in tentative and misleading ways.”
          </p>

            That sweeping failure of international (read: Western)
            scholarship has been gravely compounded in India after
            1947, when an urgent – but wholly wrong-headed, and
            ultimately destructive – revisionism swept aside and
            covered up the complex landscape of modernism in India in
            favour of the Tagores and their “Bengal Renaissance.”
            Unsubtly excluded from this lobotomized nationalist art
            history was the spectacular cultural wellspring of the
            entire west coast, but especially the legions of
            extraordinary artists from Goa who flooded to and through
            colonial and mid-20th-century Bombay to constitute what
            Ranjit Hoskote has eloquently described as “an invisible
            river, one that has fed into the wider flow of Indian art
            but has not always been recognised as so doing.”
          </p>

            In his superb curatorial essay for Aparanta: The
            Confluence of Contemporary Art in Goa, the landmark 2007
            group exhibition on the waterfront of Panjim that marked
            the return of Fonseca to prominence in the cultural fabric
            of his homeland (and also served to save the lovely 19th
            century Old Goa Medical College campus from being co-opted
            into a shopping mall) Hoskote explained some of the causes
            of this dissonance: “Goa’s special historic evolution,
            with its Lusitanian route to the Enlightenment and print
            modernity, its Iberian emphasis on a vibrant public
            sphere, its pride in its ancient internationalism avant la
            lettre, sets it at a tangent to the self-image of an India
            that has been formed with the experience of British
            colonialism as its basis. The relationship between Goa’s
            artists and mainland India has, not surprisingly, been
            ambiguous and erratic, even unstable.”
