	    It is a strange, oftentimes surreal predicament. From the
	    very inception of the paradigm-shifting Sir JJ School of
	    Art in 1878, it was sought out by vastly disproportionate
	    numbers of Goans (as were other institutions set up in
	    colonial Bombay at the same time, notably the Grant
	    Medical College). By the turn of the century, the great
	    pioneer Antonio Xavier Trindade – the heavily feted
	    “Rembrandt of the East” – was one of its first Indian
	    faculty members, and streams of his countryfolk followed
	    in his wake.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    It is important to note here that most of this grand
	    artistic legacy has been either purposefully erased from
	    the record, or deliberately co-opted into sketchy
	    narratives that efface their origins. This is because of a
	    grand overarching prejudice, because the Goa-Bombay
	    artists – which is actually the best way to understand the
	    seminal Progressive Artists Group– have always been
	    irredeemably heterogeneous. Souza’s cohort was defiantly
	    scruffy compared to the Shantiniketan bhadralok: Husain
	    painted road signs, Ara was a houseboy. The very presence
	    of these kinds of Indians has been treated as an affront
	    to Indian art history, and there can be no doubt the
	    establishment would have preferred to erase them from our
	    consciousness altogether. That surely would have happened,
	    if it had not been for increasingly wealthy non-resident
	    Indians and their impact on the 21st century art
	    marketplace.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    These are all-important cultural fault lines – and here we
	    must remember that both Souza and Gaitonde died in
	    effective penury only two decades ago – but there is
	    plenty of culpability that is shared by Goa and Goans as
	    well. We have massively compounded the art historical
	    crime that Souza pointed out way back in 1959, because
	    both state and society have displayed an unimaginably
	    cavalier disregard for our own heritage, in an astonishing
	    abdication of responsibility that has few rivals anywhere
	    in the world. Thus, despite being the inheritors of an
	    unrivalled artistic legacy that extends millennia to the
	    dawn of mankind in this part of the world, the average
	    Goan student learns exactly zero about this bountiful
	    birthright. Even worse, the government has done nothing to
	    rectify this crisis, and compiled no permanent collection
	    to speak of, while also neglecting to constitute the
	    museum framework required to properly display and explain
	    the few meagre scraps it has managed to retain after
	    generations of despoilation (for example, the Kala
	    Academy’s small trove of excellent Gaitonde canvases has
	    been “missing” for the past two decades).

	    In this giant mess, which shows no sign whatsoever of
	    being resolved, the existence of the best part of Angelo
	    da Fonseca’s oeuvre poses an epic challenge, as well as
	    its potential resolution. This ultimate bridge figure, who
	    was born into an aristocratic Luso-Indian family but spent
	    most of his life in happy anonymity in a spartan ashram in
	    Poona from the 1930s onwards, whose artwork has always
	    fallen between the cracks as too Indian for rigidly
	    Eurocentric Catholics and too Christian for
	    nationalism-blinkered Indians, has been retrieved from the
	    ash-heap of history at precisely the most promising
	    juncture, into an era that appears poised to understand
	    and appreciate his brilliant paintings for the same exact
	    reasons that our grandparents found them hard to
	    digest. This is a bolt of lightning that commands the
	    rewriting of all of our cultural notions. Here is our
	    universal master, and India’s most important early
	    modernist.
